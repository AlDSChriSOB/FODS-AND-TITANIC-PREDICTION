Fundamentals of Data Science: Data Generation and Regression Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates foundational data science techniques through practical exercises in Python. It covers random data generation, data visualization, and regression modeling (linear and polynomial). The exercises help develop skills in analyzing synthetic datasets and understanding relationships between variables.

Features
Random Data Generation:

Generate 100 random integers.

Generate 100 random floats (with 1 decimal place).

Generate 100 random 2D coordinates.

Linear Regression:

Fit a linear model to 2D coordinate data.

Calculate slope and intercept to identify trends.

Polynomial Regression:

Fit a quadratic (parabola) model to a small dataset.

Use least squares optimization to estimate parameters.

Prepare for cubic regression modeling for more complex curves.

Data Visualization:

Scatter plots for exploring data patterns.

Visualization of fitted regression curves.

Tools & Libraries
Python 3

NumPy

Matplotlib

SciPy

scikit-learn

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
